As their lives and relationship continued to unfold they became inspired to take up a practice designed to support people in creating and living a life they are passionate about. 

Both of them are Institute for Integrative Nutrition Certified Health Coaches as well as Certified Reiki Masters.

â€‹Our mission is to help you fall back madly in love with your life!

We love working with clients who find themselves in the midst of "Who am I NOW" conversation, the ones who are redefining their lives, whether it's by choice or necessity.

Sometimes, it's both. 

Life is something that either happens to you or you instead pick up the reins, swing your leg over the saddle and ride that horse gracefully through all of the bucks and twists!

We've seen that as our clients have begun approaching life with this level of skill that they just naturally become game changers -- they begin make a real difference in their world. Whether it's for yourself, your family, your community or the world at large, if you're madly in love with your life you'll begin to share and just naturally give yourself more generously and effectively in everything you do and with the people who matter most!  

We live in interesting times with the most wonderful opportunities before us and like most people we too wish to make a difference. To transform the world at a scale that would reduce or even wipe out poverty, stop wars and end needless suffering is something that we truly believe is possible. The beauty of this is that we know we are not alone. We know, see and feel that there is a beautiful new urge that is welling up in our communities. An urge that knows that we were meant to be and do so much more. That what we see is not happening TO us, but comes from the choices we make. It comes from who we choose to be in life, individually and collectively.

But for us it all starts with the individual, which is why we are here telling you our stories,  and offering you our services in the hopes of making a difference for you individually, for your family, your community and our shared world. Both of us have found ourselves in the midst of life altering challenges and difficulties many times. We've become the parents to our own aging and dying elders. We've stood on the brink of tossing away what seemed like successful careers that we knew deep inside were choking us. We've looked deep into each others eyes and thought "Who are you? and why are we together still?" and even "Do we want to be?"

What we learned is that it's all about context of how we were living our lives. For us the answers lay in who we were being, not what we were doing.

Context, in this sense of the word, is not about what you are doing or the associated circumstances. Context is all about who you are being in the matter, which is always expressed by your actions. Using this approach we began to take an "eyes wide open" look at the full landscape of our contexts, both individual and as a couple including all of the underlying assumptions or core principles that we were operating from.

It wasn't always easy, but it was worth it and in a nutshell, that's why we're here!

Mankind continues to expand quite rapidly in the areas of science and technology. But from our perspective it appears that the next great area of exploration and growth will naturally arise as one of consciousness. One where we recognize the value of love and compassion, individually and collectively!

We look forward to the opportunity to work with you. We truly believe that our work together will make an enormous difference for you, wherever you find yourself starting from and as such we completely guarantee our approach.
